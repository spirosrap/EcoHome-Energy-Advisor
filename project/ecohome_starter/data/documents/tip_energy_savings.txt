Saving energy at home can be simple and effective. Turn off lights when not in use and unplug devices that draw standby power. Use natural lighting during the day and replace incandescent bulbs with energy-efficient LEDs. Keep appliances clean and well-maintained to ensure they operate efficiently.

Smart thermostats can save up to 10% on heating and cooling costs by automatically adjusting temperatures when you're away. Set your thermostat to 68°F in winter and 78°F in summer for optimal energy savings.

Wash clothes in cold water and only run full loads. Use the dryer's moisture sensor instead of timed drying. Clean the lint filter after every load to improve efficiency.

Seal air leaks around windows and doors with weatherstripping or caulk. Add insulation to attics and walls to reduce heating and cooling needs.

Use power strips to easily turn off multiple devices at once. Many electronics continue to draw power even when turned off, known as phantom load.

Consider energy-efficient appliances when replacing old ones. Look for ENERGY STAR certified products that use 10-50% less energy than standard models.

Plant trees or install awnings to provide shade for your home during summer months. This can reduce cooling costs by up to 25%.

Use ceiling fans to circulate air and make rooms feel cooler, allowing you to raise the thermostat temperature by 4°F without discomfort.
