Maximize your rooftop solar system by tuning its performance throughout the year. Begin with a biannual panel cleaning routine; dust and pollen can reduce output by 10% or more, especially during spring bloom and late-summer dry spells. Schedule cleaning for early morning to avoid rapid temperature swings that can stress the glass.

Track production every week using your inverter portal or a home energy monitoring app. Flag days where generation drops more than 15% below the rolling average and investigate shading or inverter faults immediately. For tree shading, consult an arborist about selective trimming that keeps the canopy healthy while restoring midday sun.

Shift large appliance loads—such as laundry, dishwashers, or pool pumps—to overlap with peak solar hours between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. This increases self-consumption and reduces the amount of power exported at low feed-in tariffs. Pair the schedule with smart plugs or the appliance’s built-in delay-start mode.

If you own a battery, reserve at least 20% capacity for evening use to cover the sunset-to-bedtime peak. Configure time-of-use automation so the battery charges from solar first and only from the grid during super-off-peak windows. Adjust these rules seasonally as daylight length changes.

Inspect mounting hardware annually. Tighten lag bolts to the manufacturer torque spec and confirm flashing remains watertight. Look for signs of corrosion on rails in coastal climates; apply an appropriate anti-corrosion spray or replace hardware as needed.

For systems with microinverters or DC optimizers, update firmware when the vendor releases improvements. Many updates refine maximum power point tracking, unlocking additional output during low-irradiance mornings and hazy afternoons.

Work with your utility to enroll in solar-friendly rates. Plans that feature a midday credit or reduced daytime charge help solar households benefit from their generation. Review annual statements to ensure net-metering credits align with what your monitoring software reports, and dispute discrepancies promptly.
